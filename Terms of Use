Terms of Use
Cloud OCD is free for the 1st month before the auto-renewable subscription titled Monthly Subscription for $4.99/month is required to use the app. 
Regardless of whether the subscription has free trial period or not, it automatically renews with the price and duration given above unless it is 
canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. 
Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going 
to your account settings on the App Store after purchase. Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user 
purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.
